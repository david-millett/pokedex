# Pokedex

This project was designed as a way to demonstrate wrangling and transforming large datasets ready for frontend use. Also with a focus on efficiency.

Using the PokeAPI as a fun initial project - this RESTful API interface stores thousands of lines of data relating to pokemon

Day 1 

Set up a `pokemonService.js` file to get the pokemon data. As per the API's rules, and to follow good practice, the data was saved to local storage to minimise API requests and improve overall efficiency. HOW?

Initially, the dataset was limited to the original 151 pokemon.
